Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
An RTO of one hour for this incident would be reasonable.
if the RTO is 1 hour and disaster occurs at 12:00 p.m (noon), 
then the DR process should restore the systems to an acceptable 
service level within an hour i.e. by 1:00 p.m

A reasonable RPO would require:
Create an RDS MySQL database with automatic backups enabled
Once the database is available, it is fully functional and can be used for any relational workload.
You can connect to the database and insert a sample set of data.
Restore the database to a prior point in time.
if a disaster occurs at 12:00 p.m (noon) and the RPO is one hour, 
the system should recover all data that was in the system before 11:00 a.m.
