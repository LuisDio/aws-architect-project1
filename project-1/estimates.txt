Recover Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum time your platform or service can be unavailable.
=============================================================================================
- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 
  considering our RDS is running on subnet group of two subnet which is on different az, it would
  take about 6 minutes since this will require starting up a new RDS on the other AZ then applying 
  all changes since the last backup.

- Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 
  considering our RDS has a standby replicas in an other region,
  It would take about 8 minutes With cross-region read replica, which
  we can promote the replica with minimum downtime.


The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of time that your system can lose data.
================================================================================================
- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage:
  considering our RDS is still running on subnet group with each subnet residing in different AZ,
  It would be about 12 minutes for data to be lost from the AZ outage up to the time of failover.

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 
  considering our RDS has a standby replicas in an other region,
  It would take about 16 minutes. RPO here would be the time it takes for the database replica in 
  the standby region to be promoted and operative.
